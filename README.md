# Cosmic Guardian 2nd Update
- ADDED: spawnAsteriods function, rockets (spawn in when SPACE is pressed), Plane/jet cannot collide with earth.
## ASTERIOD SPEED
- Also added variable which regulates the speed of which the asteriods fall towards Earth on Y-axis. This variable is called "asteriodSpeed"
- This variable can also allow for progressive hardness for the player of the game. As you can already see in the code in the spawnAsteriods function that the asteriod speed is being multiplied.
- Later when collision between the sprites of "rocket" and "asteriod" is coded in, we can also add a line of code which can increase the variable by and increment. This makes the asteriod fall down faster.
